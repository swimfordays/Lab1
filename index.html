            <p>Don't worry, I'm from IT! Seriously. I work at an IT help desk for a healthcare enterprise. 'Healthcare enterprise'
                is fancy terminology for a place where, as I'm told, med students go to try and pay off student loans.</p>

            <p>I've been working in that field for about six months. It involves a decent bit of technical writing. I've
                always had a knack for writing, allegedly. Trying to catch the right word for a moment is a fun challenge.</p>

            <p>Before IT I was a caffeine-addled barista. I'm still fairly caffeine-addled. It's a jittery lifestyle but
                it suits my line of work fairly well.</p>

            <h4>Caffeine tolerance is over-rated.</h4>
            <p>I started learning more about computer science so I can hone the direction my career path's heading. I'm having
                a daughter soon! I look forward to harnessing a skill that will net enough income to satiate my caffeine
                habit & buy any kid-thing her heart desires.</p>

            <p>Some day I will work remotely so I can watch my daughter grow. Every day her arrival gets closer I become

            <p>For now my focus is to master new computer science skills, add some development & network security weapons
                to my arsenal, pay back some generous creditors, and find a nice comfortable house to purchase. The turbocharged
                BMW can wait a few years.</p>
